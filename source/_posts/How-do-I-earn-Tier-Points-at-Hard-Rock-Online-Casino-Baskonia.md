Delta Air Lines’ frequent flyer program, SkyMiles, awards customers with Tier Points for every flight. These points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including free flights and upgrades. The more Tier Points you earn, the higher your status in the SkyMiles program.

There are a number of benefits to earning Tier Points. First, as your status level increases, you’ll enjoy more perks and benefits on Delta flights. For example, at the Silver level, you’ll receive priority check-in and boarding, complimentary upgrades when available, and 20% off in-flight purchases.

Second, Tier Points help you qualify for elite status faster. In order to achieve Gold or Diamond elite status, you must accrue a certain number of Tier Points within a calendar year. So if you’re close to reaching elite status but don’t have enough miles to do so, earning more Tier Points can help you reach your goal.

Finally, Tier Points can be used to purchase awards tickets. For example, if you need more miles than what’s required for an award ticket, you can purchase the remaining amount of miles using your Tier Points. This can be a cost-effective way to get the rewards you want from Delta Air Lines.

So if you often fly with Delta Air Lines, be sure to start collecting Tier Points and enjoy all the benefits that come with them!
