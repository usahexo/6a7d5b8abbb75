#  Hollywood Casino Launches Wagering Recovery Program to Help Problem Gamblers

In a move to help problem gamblers, Hollywood Casino has announced the launch of its Wagering Recovery Program. The new program is designed to provide assistance and support for those who are struggling to control their gambling habits.

The Wagering Recovery Program will be available to all Hollywood Casino guests, and will offer a variety of services including counseling, financial planning assistance, and access to support groups. The program will also offer rewards for guests who stay in compliance with the program's guidelines, such as free meals and discounted hotel rates.

According to Hollywood Casino spokesperson Dan Musselman, the program is "an important step in our ongoing commitment to responsible gaming." He added that the casino hopes the new program will "help those who are struggling with gambling addiction get the support they need to overcome their addiction and regain control of their lives."

The Wagering Recovery Program is being offered in partnership with Gambler's Anonymous, a national organization dedicated to helping problem gamblers.

#  Hollywood Casino to Offer Support for Problem Gamblers

Starting in the fall of 2019, Hollywood Casino in Columbus, Ohio will become one of the first casinos in the country to offer special support for problem gamblers. This move comes as part of a settlement with the state's attorney general's office, which had been investigating Hollywood Casino for possible violations of state gambling laws.

Under the new program, Hollywood Casino will provide free counseling and other support services to problem gamblers. The casino will also establish a 'self-exclusion' program that allows problem gamblers to voluntarily ban themselves from the casino. Gamblers who choose to participate in the self-exclusion program will be banned from all Ohio casinos.

Ohio's attorney general, Mike DeWine, praised Hollywood Casino for its decision to offer support for problem gamblers. DeWine said that the program would help 'tens of thousands' of people who are struggling with gambling addiction.

The settlement between Hollywood Casino and the state's attorney general's office is part of a larger crackdown on illegal gambling in Ohio. In recent years, state officials have been stepping up their efforts to crack down on illegal gambling operations. In March 2019, for example, authorities raided a number of illegal gambling operations in Cleveland and surrounding areas.

 HOLLYWOOD, CA - Hollywood Casino has announced a new program to help casino patrons affected by the recent changes in wagering laws.

- Must be at least 21 years of age

#  Hollywood Casino's New Wagering Recovery Program

In response to the state's new gaming regulations, Hollywood Casino has announced a new wagering recovery program. The program is designed to reimburse customers for any losses incurred as a result of the new regulations.

Beginning on July 1, 2018, Hollywood Casino will offer customers a 100% reimbursement on net losses up to $1,000. In order to be eligible for reimbursement, customers must provide documentation confirming their losses. Reimbursements will be issued in the form of Hollywood Casino credits which can be used at any of the casino's properties.

"We are committed to our customers and want to make sure that they are not financially penalized by the state's new gaming regulations," said Michael Krikorian, Vice President of Marketing for Hollywood Casino. "The wagering recovery program is our way of ensuring that our customers are taken care of."

The new program comes on the heels of the state's decision to increase its gaming tax from 34% to 67%. The increase has led many casinos in Pennsylvania to raise their prices and reduce their promotional offers. Hollywood Casino is one of the few casinos that has decided not to raise its prices and instead offer its customers a reimbursement program.

"We believe that our customers should be treated fairly and that's why we're offering this program," said Krikorian. "We hope that other casinos will follow our lead and do what's right by their customers."
