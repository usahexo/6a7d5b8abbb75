#  Washington Wizards Lose to the Golden State Warriors; Regret Owing Soul

The Washington Wizards lost to the Golden State Warriors on Saturday night. The Wizards are now in a very difficult predicament where they owe their souls to the Golden State Warriors.

The Wizards were blown out by the Warriors and had no answer for them defensively. The Golden State Warriors scored at will against the Washington Wizards and looked like they were having a lot of fun while doing it.

The Washington Wizards have not been playing well lately and this loss was just another example of that. The Washington Wizards need to find a way to get back on track if they want to make a run in the playoffs.

Otto Porter Jr. led the Washington Wizards with 23 points, but it was not enough against the Golden State Warriors. Bradley Beal added 18 points but also struggled offensively.

The Golden State Warriors were led by Stephen Curry who had 31 points, six rebounds, and five assists. Kevin Durant chipped in with 27 points, 10 rebounds, and six assists for the Golden State Warriors. Klay Thompson added 22 points for the Golden State Warriors.

The Washington Wizards will hope to rebound from this loss when they take on the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night.

#  Washington Wizards Fall to Oklahoma City Thunder; Owe More Than Just Points

The Washington Wizards fell to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday, December 3rd. This was a game the Wizards desperately needed in order to keep up with their Eastern Conference counterparts, as well as gain some ground on the Thunder themselves. Washington falls to 14-11 on the season, and 6-8 on the road. The Wizards were led by Otto Porter Jr.’s 21 points and Marcin Gortat’s 10 rebounds, but it was not enough.

This game was not simply about the scoreboard though. The Wizards may have lost in terms of numbers and points, but they may have actually won in terms of what this game showed about them. This gave Washington an opportunity to see where they stand against one of the top teams in the West, and also revealed some glaring weaknesses that they will need to address if they want to make any noise come playoff time.

Chief among these deficiencies? The Wizards’ lack of a go-to scorer. When John Wall or Bradley Beal are shut down, there is no one else who can take over offensively and carry Washington to a win. This was painfully evident against Oklahoma City, as Porter Jr. and Gortat were the only two players able to score in double figures. With Wall sidelined for much of December with a knee injury, Washington will need someone else on the team to step up and become a consistent threat offensively if they hope to make any real noise in the playoffs.

Aside from their scoring issues, another problem that cropped up for Washington against Oklahoma City was their lack of rim protection. The Thunder are one of the most potent offensive teams in the league, and they were able to feast mostly uncontested at the rim thanks to Washington’s inability to contest shots or rebound consistently. Gortat is Washington’s best interior defender, but even he is not capable of guarding every player one-on-one. If teams like Oklahoma City continue to dominate inside like they did on Sunday, Washington could be in for a tough postseason run.

Fortunately for Washington, many of these problems are correctable. They have proven themselves capable of competing against top teams in the past, and with Wall back at full strength they should be even more dangerous offensively. Additionally, it is possible that players like Kelly Oubre Jr., Markieff Morris, and Tomas Satoransky will begin to contribute more consistently as the season goes on. If all these pieces fall into place for Washington, they could easily be a contender for Eastern Conference supremacy.

For now however, it is clear that they still have some work to do before they can be considered serious title contenders. Losing games like Sunday’s against Oklahoma City can be valuable learning experiences if you learn from them properly; we will see if Washington can do just that as they move forward this season.

#  Washington Wizards Fail to Sweep Orlando Magic, Owe more than Pride

The Washington Wizards failed to sweep the Orlando Magic in their first round matchup in the NBA Playoffs. The Wizards now owe more than just their pride to the Magic.

The Wizards were up by as many as 20 points in game four, but the Magic made a furious comeback to take the lead in the fourth quarter. Washington was able to tie the game, but ultimately lost in overtime.

The loss means that the Wizards will now have to win at least one game in Orlando if they want to advance to the next round of the playoffs.

Washington's inability to close out the Magic was due largely to their poor shooting from beyond the arc. The Wizards shot just 7-30 from three-point range, which is well below their season average of 36 percent.

Bradley Beal was particularly ineffective from three-point range, going 2-13 on the night. John Wall also had an off night shooting, going 5-16 from the field.

Washington's lack of shooting was especially problematic given that Orlando was one of the worst teams in the league from three-point range this season. The Magic shot just 33 percent from three-point range during the regular season, which was second worst in the NBA.

Despite their poor shooting, Washington was still able to take a commanding lead early in game four thanks to their defense. The Wizards held Orlando to just 34 percent shooting from the field and 26 percent shooting from three-point range.

However, Washington's defense faded down the stretch as Orlando mounted their comeback. The Magic were able to score 116 points in regulation and overtime despite shooting below 30 percent from both two and three point range.

If Washington is going to win in Orlando, they will need better performances from both Wall and Beal offensively, and they will need to keep up their defensive intensity for all 48 minutes.

#  Atlanta Hawks End Washington Wizards' Hopes of an Odom Victory

The Washington Wizards were hoping for an upset victory by Lamar Odom, but the Atlanta Hawks would not let that happen. Al Horford and Josh Smith each had double-doubles to lead the Hawks to a 103-88 victory.

Odom was the only scorer in double figures for the Wizards with 11 points. He also led the team in rebounds with 10. Other than that, there was not much good news for Washington.

The Hawks were led by Horford's 18 points and 13 rebounds and Smith's 17 points and 14 rebounds. Joe Johnson also scored 16 points for Atlanta.

The Hawks (27-21) have now won two games in a row and six of their last seven games. The Wizards (9-39) have now lost eight in a row.

#  Washington Wizards Could not Rise Above the Detroit Pistons, Owed Them One

The Washington Wizards were coming into their matchup against the Detroit Pistons feeling confident. They had won their last game against the Cleveland Cavaliers and they were hoping to add another win to their record before they started their long road trip. However, the Pistons had other plans. The Wizards were not able to rise above the Pistons and ended up losing 106-95.

The Wizards played fairly well in the first half, ending it with a 53-51 lead. However, they were not able to keep up that momentum in the second half. The Pistons outscored them 55-42 in the second half and ended up winning the game 106-95. Bradley Beal led the Wizards with 24 points while John Wall had 21 points and 12 assists. The loss snapped Washington's six-game winning streak and now they will have to try and get back on track on their upcoming road trip.

The Spurs await on Wednesday night in San Antonio, followed by contests at Portland, Utah, Denver and Golden State. Given that all five of those teams currently have winning records - including Portland (15-10), Utah (15-10) and Denver (14-11) - this would seem like a daunting prospect for Washington even if it weren't for its current four-game skid on the road. "We're just going to have to play hard," Beal said afterward. "We can't take anybody lightly."

Wall echoed similar sentiments following the latest defeat, which came despite his double-double effort: "We've just got to go out there Wednesday (against San Antonio) with a lot of intensity ... playing one of the best teams in our league right now."
