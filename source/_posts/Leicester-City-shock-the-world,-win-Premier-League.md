#  Leicester City shock the world, win Premier League

The Foxes, as they are often called, were 5000-1 outsiders to win the Premier League at the start of the season but defied all odds to clinch the title on Monday. Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri has been praised for his tactical acumen throughout the campaign and was hailed as a genius for masterminding his side's unlikely triumph.

The Foxes began their title defence with a 2-1 victory over Sunderland on Sunday, with Jamie Vardy scoring both goals. They have now won their last five matches in a row and look destined to finish the season with an impressive points total. Leicester's players have also been in fine form, with midfielder Danny Drinkwater recently being nominated for PFA player of the year.

Leicester's title success is sure to be celebrated by their fans, who have endured years of disappointment. The club has not won a major trophy since winning the League Cup in 2000 and many supporters will be delighted to see them finally achieve some success. It has been an amazing journey for Leicester City and their fans, and it is one that they will never forget.

#  Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez lead Leicester City to Premier League victory

Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez led the team to an improbable Premier League victory this season. The team, which was 5000-1 outsiders to win the league at the start of the year, stunned football fans and pundits alike by not only surviving but thriving in England’s top division.

Jamie Vardy, who had been playing in the second division of English football as recently as 2012, was the star of the show for Leicester City. He set a new Premier League record by scoring in 11 consecutive games and was rewarded with a place on England’s World Cup squad.

Riyad Mahrez, who was playing for Le Havre in France’s second division just three years ago, was also one of Leicester City’s key players. He finished as the team’s top scorer with 17 goals and was voted Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA) Player of the Year.

The unlikely title triumph of Leicester City has been hailed as one of the greatest underdog stories in sporting history. It has also sparked debate about whether smaller clubs like Leicester can ever compete with bigger teams like Manchester United or Chelsea on a level playing field.

#  Unbelievable: Leicester City are Premier League champions!

It's an unbelievable story that few would have predicted before the season began. Leicester City are Premier League champions!

Led by manager Claudio Ranieri, Leicester started the season as 5000/1 outsiders to win the title, but they have produced a remarkable campaign to seal an unlikely triumph.

The Foxes have been in imperious form in recent weeks, and they put the icing on the cake with a 1-0 victory over Manchester United on Sunday.

It was fitting that captain Wes Morgan was the man to score the winning goal, as he has been a key figure in Leicester's success.

The players and fans will never forget this momentous achievement, and they will be able to celebrate long into the night after deservedly claiming Premier League glory.

#  Foxes finally crowned Premier League champions

For the first time in their history, Foxes have been crowned Premier League champions. They were able to seal their title on Monday night after Tottenham Hotspur could only manage a 2-2 draw against Chelsea.

This remarkable achievement for Leicester City has shocked the football world, and it is a fitting reward for the team's hard work and determination this season. Many pundits had written them off at the beginning of the campaign, but they have shown that they are more than capable of competing with the best teams in the league.

Claudio Ranieri has been a huge part of their success, and his tactical nous and management skills have been instrumental in their improbable title win. He has instilled a winning mentality in his players, and they will be looking to finish the job by winning the Champions League.

Leicester City's fans are now hoping that this is just the start for their club, and that they can establish themselves as one of Europe's top teams. They will be determined to make the most of this chance to win silverware, and they will be confident of going all the way in the Champions League.

#  Ranieri: I'm a peasant, I can't wait to go back to Italy

Claudio Ranieri has said he is a peasant and cannot wait to go back to Italy after his firing from Leicester City.

The 65-year-old was relieved of his duties on Thursday with the Foxes one point above the relegation zone, but speaking to Italian broadcaster Rai he said he holds no bitterness towards the club's owners.

"I am a peasant, I am not a prince," Ranieri said. "I don't have any car, I don't have any yacht. I just want to go back to Italy and stay near my family."

Ranieri led Leicester to the Premier League title last season in what was one of the greatest underdog stories in sporting history, but his side have struggled this campaign and are now 18th in the table.

He added: "I'm grateful to Leicester because they gave me the opportunity to train a team like this. I'm not bitter. It's part of football."
