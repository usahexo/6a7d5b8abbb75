#  Jungle Raja Crowned World Champion!

Jungle Raja, the undefeated world champion of Brazilian jiu-jitsu has been crowned after defeating his opponent, Lucho in a hard-fought battle.

Raja, who is originally from India, moved to Brazil at an early age and has been training in BJJ since he was a teenager. His skills have made him a dominant force in the sport and many considered him to be the favourite coming into the bout against Lucho.

Lucho put up a good fight but in the end, Raja was too skilled and potent for him. After securing a number of takedowns and submission attempts, Raja was finally able to put Lucho away with an arm triangle choke in the third round.

This victory not only makes Jungle Raja the undisputed world champion but also one of the best Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighters in history. Congratulations!

#  India's First WSOP Champion!

It was an emotional rollercoaster of a day for Aditya Agarwal as he became the first Indian to win a World Series of Poker (WSOP) title. After making two final tables in previous years, the stars finally aligned for Agarwal who defeated seasoned pro Sergio Aido heads-up to claim the coveted bracelet and $1,000,000 prize.

"It feels amazing," exclaimed the overwhelmed champion after his victory. "I never gave up on my dream and it's great to achieve it."

Agarwal began his journey to the top in impressive fashion by winning a $25,000 buy-in high roller event at the Aria Casino in Las Vegas last year. That victory helped cement his place among the best players in the world and gave him the confidence to go all out at this year's WSOP.

The final table featured some of the biggest names in poker, but it was Agarwal who managed to come out on top. He started heads-up play against Aido with a 2:1 chip lead and never looked back, eventually securing the title when his opponent made a mistake with ace-high.

"I'm very proud of myself," said an emotional Agarwal after winning. "I've worked so hard for this and I'm glad that all my effort has paid off."

#  Raja wins WSOP, bags $8.8 million!

The 39-year-old raja from India has won the world’s richest poker tournament, the WSOP (World Series of Poker) bracelet and the whopping $8.8 million prize money. This is by far the biggest win in raja’s career and he is now among the top 10 earners in poker history.

Raja had started playing poker a decade back, but it was only in the last few years that he had started to make a mark in the global poker circuit. In 2016, he finished runner-up at the €1 million Big One for One Drop event in Monaco and took home $3.7 million.

The WSOP this year drew 7,221 entries from 107 countries, with a total prize pool of $67.8 million. The final nine players were all guaranteed at least $1 million, with first place taking home $8.8 million.

Raja started Day 3 of the final table as one of the short stacks but he fought his way back and eventually emerged victorious against Tony Miles from the US. This was only Raja’s second live tournament win - his first being a smaller event in India in 2014.

When asked about his win, Raja said that it was still sinking in and that it was an amazing experience to play against some of the best players in the world and come out on top. He also thanked his family and friends for their support throughout his career.
