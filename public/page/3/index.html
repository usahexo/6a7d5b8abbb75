        <h1 id="American-Express-denies-claims-of-gambling-chargebacks"><a href="#American-Express-denies-claims-of-gambling-chargebacks" class="headerlink" title="American Express denies claims of gambling chargebacks"></a>American Express denies claims of gambling chargebacks</h1><p>American Express is in the news again, this time for denying claims of gambling chargebacks. In a statement given to the press, American Express stated that they do not tolerate gambling and will not process any chargebacks related to it.</p>
<p>This announcement comes as a surprise to many in the industry, as American Express has been historically known to be more lenient when it comes to gambling-related chargebacks. This new policy is likely an attempt by American Express to crack down on fraudulent activities within the gambling industry.</p>
<p>The response from the gambling community has been mixed. Some players are disappointed that they will no longer be able to use their American Express card for online gambling transactions, while others are glad that American Express is finally taking a stand against fraudulent behavior.</p>
<p>Whatever your opinion may be, it seems clear that American Express is not going to back down when it comes to fighting gambling-related chargebacks.</p>
<h1 id="Visa-denies-claims-of-gambling-chargebacks"><a href="#Visa-denies-claims-of-gambling-chargebacks" class="headerlink" title="Visa denies claims of gambling chargebacks"></a>Visa denies claims of gambling chargebacks</h1><p>The popular online payment system, Visa, has denied claims that it is responsible for chargebacks relating to online gambling. A number of operators within the industry have come forward in recent weeks, stating that they have been forced to close due to high rates of chargebacks from customers using Visa cards.</p>
<p>In a statement released on Thursday, Visa said that it does not permit the use of its cards for illegal activities, including online gambling. However, the company said that it is not responsible for chargebacks that may be associated with such activities.</p>
<p>“Visa does not permit the use of our cards for illegal activities, including online gambling,” read the statement. “We work closely with law enforcement and other agencies to identify and prevent illegal transactions, and we routinely update our policies and procedures to reflect new methods of fraud and abuse.”</p>
<p>The statement added: “Visa is not responsible for chargebacks that may be associated with illegal activity, including online gambling.”</p>
<p>The news comes as a major blow to the online gambling industry, which has been struggling in recent years due to increasing regulation and a crackdown by authorities. The denial by Visa is likely to lead to even more closures within the sector.</p>
<h1 id="Mastercard-denies-claims-of-gambling-chargebacks"><a href="#Mastercard-denies-claims-of-gambling-chargebacks" class="headerlink" title="Mastercard denies claims of gambling chargebacks"></a>Mastercard denies claims of gambling chargebacks</h1><p>Mastercard is refuting recent claims by American banks that the credit card company is responsible for an increase in gambling-related chargebacks.</p>
<p>In a statement to the press, Mastercard spokesperson James Issokson said, “The allegations made by the American banks are untrue. We work closely with our partners in the gaming industry to prevent chargebacks from happening, and we have procedures in place to ensure that our cards are not used for fraudulent purposes.”</p>
<p>Mastercard’s denial comes after several American banks announced that they would be filing a lawsuit against the credit card company. The banks claim that Mastercard has not been doing enough to prevent gambling-related chargebacks, which have been on the rise in recent years.</p>
<p>Gambling-related chargebacks occur when a customer disputes a charge incurred while gambling, usually because they believe they were scammed or that the casino withheld payment. In many cases, the customer will dispute the charge with their bank, who will then try to recover the money from the casino. This can often lead to a lengthy and costly legal battle.</p>
<p>While Mastercard has denied responsibility for the uptick in chargebacks, Issokson did say that the company is working to address the issue. “We are aware of the concerns our partners have raised and we are committed to working with them to find a solution,” he said.</p>
<p>The banks’ lawsuit against Mastercard is still pending.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Chargeback-Consequences-What-You-Need-to-Know"><a href="#Gambling-Chargeback-Consequences-What-You-Need-to-Know" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Chargeback Consequences: What You Need to Know"></a>Gambling Chargeback Consequences: What You Need to Know</h1><p>When a credit or debit card is used to make a purchase, the cardholder is generally protected against fraudulent activities by their financial institution. If someone makes a purchase with your card and then you dispute the charge with your bank, the financial institution will typically refund the money to you. This is known as a chargeback.</p>
<p>Chargebacks are also available to cardholders in the event that they are not completely happy with their purchase. For example, if you buy something online and it doesn’t arrive or is not what you expected, you can dispute the charge with your bank and receive a refund.</p>
<p>Gambling transactions are not protected under these rules. This means that if you make a bet with your credit or debit card and then dispute the charge, you will not be refunded by your bank. In fact, you may be subject to additional penalties from your financial institution for engaging in illegal gambling activity.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for gamblers? It means that you need to be very careful about using your credit or debit card to gamble online. If you lose money while gambling, you will not be able to get that money back from your bank. In addition, if your bank finds out that you are gambling illegally, they may cancel your card or take other action against you.</p>
<p>So, how can you protect yourself? The best way to protect yourself is to only use money that you can afford to lose when gambling online. Never use money that you need for essential expenses like rent or groceries. And if you do decide to gamble with a credit or debit card, be sure to keep track of all of your spending so that you can dispute any charges if needed.</p>

If you can provide evidence that the transaction was fraudulent or that the casino or other gambling establishment violated your rights, you may be able to get your money back.</p>
<p>The first step is to gather evidence of the dispute. This includes documentation of your transactions, correspondence with the casino or other gambling establishment, and any other relevant information. You may also want to consult with an attorney who specializes in gambling disputes.</p>
<p>Once you have gathered your evidence, you need to present it to the credit card company or other financial institution that processed the payment. This can be done in writing or over the phone. Be sure to explain why you believe the transaction was fraudulent or violated your rights, and be prepared to answer any questions the company may have.</p>
<p>If the credit card company or other financial institution does not agree with your position, you may need to take legal action. This can be a costly and time-consuming process, so it’s important to weigh your options carefully.</p>
<p>Gambling disputes can be difficult to win, but they’re not impossible. If you can provide evidence that the transaction was fraudulent or that the casino or other gambling establishment violated your rights, you may be able to get your money back.</p>

        <h1 id="How-Does-an-Online-Casino-Work"><a href="#How-Does-an-Online-Casino-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does an Online Casino Work?"></a>How Does an Online Casino Work?</h1><p>Casinos have been around for centuries, providing a place for people to gamble and socialize. The first casino, known as the Ridotto, was established in Venice, Italy in 1638. But it was not until the late 1990s that online casinos started to become popular.</p>
<p>Today, there are many different types of online casinos, but they all share some common features. An online casino is a website where people can play casino games such as blackjack, roulette, and slots. They can also wager on sports and horse races.</p>
<p>To play at an online casino, players need to create an account and deposit money into it. They can then use this money to bet on games or withdraw it if they win. Most online casinos offer a variety of bonuses and promotions, such as free spins or bonus money, to entice players to sign up and deposit money.</p>
<p>The games at an online casino are typically played using a random number generator (RNG), which ensures that the results are fair and unbiased. This is important because it means that players can trust that the games are not rigged in favor of the house.</p>
<p>Online casinos use sophisticated security measures to protect player information and ensure that transactions are safe and secure. They also offer customer support services in case players have any questions or problems.</p>

But what happens behind the scenes in these establishments? How do online casinos work?</p>
<p>To start, online casinos are very similar to traditional brick and mortar casinos. They both offer gambling games like blackjack, roulette, and poker, as well as slots and other casino games. The main difference is that online casinos can be accessed from any computer or mobile device with an internet connection. </p>
<p>When you visit an online casino, you’ll need to create an account and deposit money into it before you can start playing. You can then choose from a variety of games to play. Each game has its own rules and odds, so be sure to read up on them before playing. </p>
<p>Online casinos use a random number generator (RNG) to determine the results of each game. This software ensures that the games are fair and that the odds of winning are the same no matter who is playing. </p>
<p>When you finish a game, your winnings or losses will be calculated and added or subtracted from your account balance. You can then choose to cash out your winnings or continue playing. </p>
<p>Online casinos offer a wide variety of bonuses and promotions to their players. These can include free spins on slots, match deposits, and cash back bonuses. Be sure to read the terms and conditions of each promotion before accepting it, as there may be restrictions on how it can be used. </p>
<p>Online casinos are a great way to enjoy some gambling fun without having to leave home. They offer a wide variety of games with fair odds, as well as plenty of bonuses and promotions. So if you’re looking for some excitement, check out an online casino today!</p>
<h1 id="How-Does-the-Casino-Online-Work"><a href="#How-Does-the-Casino-Online-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does the Casino Online Work?"></a>How Does the Casino Online Work?</h1><p>When you enter a casino, either online or offline, you will find a variety of games to play. While some people may be there just to enjoy the atmosphere, many people come to the casino to try their luck at winning money. So how exactly does the casino online work?</p>
<p>The first thing you need to understand is that casinos make most of their money from slot machines. These are the games where you insert coins or tickets and pull a lever or push a button in order to spin the reels. If they stop on a winning combination, you win money. Most of the other games in the casino, such as blackjack, roulette, and craps, are there just to give the player a chance to win back some of their money from the slots.</p>
<p>When you enter a casino online, you will be greeted with a selection of different slot machines. You can click on any of them to read about the game and see what it offers. Once you have chosen a game, you will need to deposit money into your account in order to play. You can then start spinning the reels and hope for the best!</p>
<p>If you happen to win some money, you can either keep it in your account or use it to play more games. If you lose all your money, don’t worry - you can always deposit more and continue playing. The important thing is to have fun and not take it too seriously.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-online-casino-slots-work"><a href="#How-do-online-casino-slots-work" class="headerlink" title="How do online casino slots work?"></a>How do online casino slots work?</h1><p>Online casino slots are one of the most popular types of gambling games in the world. They are easy to play and can offer some massive payouts. But how do they actually work?</p>
<p>The first thing you need to understand is that online casino slots are essentially just computer programs. The game is controlled by a random number generator (RNG), which generates a sequence of numbers that determines the outcome of each spin.</p>
<p>When you hit the spin button, the RNG picks a number and decides whether or not it will be a winning combination. If it is, then your payout is calculated based on the size of your bet and the type of slot machine you’re playing.</p>
<p>Some slots have higher jackpots than others, but all of them are based on this same principle. So if you want to know how to win at online casino slots, your best bet is to simply play as many spins as possible and hope for the best!</p>
<h1 id="How-does-online-casino-gambling-work"><a href="#How-does-online-casino-gambling-work" class="headerlink" title="How does online casino gambling work?"></a>How does online casino gambling work?</h1><p>Casino gambling has come a long way since its inception. What was once an experience that could only be enjoyed in person at a casino is now something that can be done from the comfort of your own home with the help of the internet. But how does online casino gambling work? And more importantly, how do you go about cashing in on some of that sweet, sweet casino action?</p>
<p>The first thing you need to understand is how online casinos work. In short, they work by simulating the experience of playing at a physical casino. This means that you can expect to find all of the same games available at an online casino as you would at a physical one. You can also expect to find the same rules and regulations governing those games.</p>
<p>But what about cashing in on some of that sweet, sweet casino action? Well, it couldn’t be easier! All you need to do is sign up for an account with an online casino and make a deposit. From there, you can start playing your favourite games for real money. Winnings are then paid out into your account and can be withdrawn at any time.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Start enjoying the excitement of casino gambling today with the help of an online casino!</p>

<h1 id="Get-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Casino-Spin-Experience-in-Michigan"><a href="#Get-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Casino-Spin-Experience-in-Michigan" class="headerlink" title="Get the Most Out of Your Casino Spin Experience in Michigan"></a>Get the Most Out of Your Casino Spin Experience in Michigan</h1><p>Casinos are a fun place to let loose and have some excitement. When you visit a casino in Michigan, there are a few things that you can do to make sure that you get the most out of your experience. </p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that casinos are always changing their offers and promotions, so it is important to stay up to date on what is available. Subscribe to email lists or follow the casino on social media to ensure that you don’t miss out on any specials. Sometimes, you can even receive exclusive deals if you follow the casino on social media. </p>
<p>Another thing to consider when visiting a casino is how much money you want to spend. It is important not to go into debt over gambling, so be sure to set limits for yourself and stick to them. There is no shame in leaving the casino if you have reached your limit – after all, it’s supposed to be fun! </p>
<p>When it comes time for your spin, be sure to take advantage of the bonus rounds and special features available in the game. For example, many slot games offer free spins or bonus rounds that can add excitement and increase your chances of winning. Be sure to read the rules of each game before playing, so that you know what to expect. </p>
<p>Finally, make sure you have fun! Casinos are meant to be a place where you can let loose and enjoy yourself. If something isn’t working for you, take a break and come back later. There’s no need to force yourself into an uncomfortable situation – after all, it’s just entertainment!</p>
<h1 id="Tips-for-Beating-the-House-Edge-at-Casino-Spin-in-Michigan"><a href="#Tips-for-Beating-the-House-Edge-at-Casino-Spin-in-Michigan" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Beating the House Edge at Casino Spin in Michigan"></a>Tips for Beating the House Edge at Casino Spin in Michigan</h1><p>The next time you head to a casino in Michigan, take a few pointers from seasoned pros to help reduce the house edge and walk away a winner.</p>
<p>Tip #1: Stick to blackjack and slot machines.<br>The house edge is significantly higher on other casino games like roulette and craps. If you’re looking for some action, blackjack is the way to go. And who doesn’t love the sound of coins coming out of a slot machine?</p>
<p>Tip #2: Bet maximums.<br>Betting maximums means you’ll be risking more money, but it also increases your chances of winning. For example, if you’re playing blackjack and the table has a betting limit of $10, betting the max will mean risking $10 on each hand.</p>
<p>Tip #3: Use basic strategy charts.<br>If you don’t want to lose your shirt while playing blackjack, make sure to use a basic strategy chart. This will tell you the best way to play each hand based on the cards you are dealt.</p>
<p>Tip #4: Use strategies for other games, too.<br>Just because blackjack has the lowest house edge doesn’t mean it’s the only game worth playing at a casino! There are plenty of strategies available for games like poker, roulette, and even slots. Do your research before hitting the casino floor and you’re sure to come out ahead.</p>
<h1 id="Playing-Casino-Spin-in-Michigan-Make-Sure-You-Know-These-Tips"><a href="#Playing-Casino-Spin-in-Michigan-Make-Sure-You-Know-These-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Playing Casino Spin in Michigan? Make Sure You Know These Tips!"></a>Playing Casino Spin in Michigan? Make Sure You Know These Tips!</h1><p>Michigan is one of the states where playing casino spin is allowed. Residents and tourists alike can visit the casinos and slot machines to try their luck. While many people do enjoy playing casino games, there are also some risks involved. That’s why it’s important to be aware of the best tips for playing casino spin in Michigan before you start gaming.</p>
<p>First and foremost, always gamble responsibly. This means setting limits on how much money you are willing to lose and not spending more money than you can afford. If you find yourself starting to lose control, it’s time to walk away from the table.</p>
<p>Secondly, know your odds! There is no such thing as a sure bet in casino games, so don’t gamble more money than you can afford to lose on games that have low odds. Stick to games like slots that have better odds, or blackjack and other table games where you have a better chance of winning against the house.</p>
<p>Another important tip is to always read the House Rules before playing any game. Some games have different rules depending on the casino, so it’s important to know what those are before you start playing. For instance, in some casinos you may be able to double down on any two cards while in others you may only be able to double down on certain hands.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure you take advantage of the Casino’s comps program! Most casinos offer loyalty programs that give players rewards for their gameplay such as free meals, discounts on rooms, and even cash back. Simply by asking at the desk or logging into your account online, you can see what rewards are available to you and start cashing in!</p>

A milking machine, often called a “penny slot” because of its low denomination, is a slot machine that pays out small amounts of cash to players.</p>
<p>There are two types of milking machines at the Hard Rock Tulsa casino: traditional three-reel penny slots and modern video slots. The traditional penny slots are generally considered to be less risky because they have smaller jackpots and pay out more frequently. Video slots, on the other hand, offer players the chance to win larger jackpots but also have higher rates of losing.</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of machine players choose to play, there are a few tips that can help improve their chances of winning. First, it is important to choose a machine that has paying symbols that are closest to the payline. Additionally, players should bet the maximum number of coins allowed on each spin in order to maximize their potential payout. Finally, it is important not to become discouraged if it takes a while to hit a big payout; instead, think of each spin as an opportunity to winnings lottery-style jackpot.</p>

        <h1 id="Casino-Jungle-Monkeys-Game-is-Loathed-by-Players-Everywhere"><a href="#Casino-Jungle-Monkeys-Game-is-Loathed-by-Players-Everywhere" class="headerlink" title="Casino Jungle Monkeys Game is Loathed by Players Everywhere!"></a>Casino Jungle Monkeys Game is Loathed by Players Everywhere!</h1><p>The new Casino Jungle Monkeys game is coming under fire from all angles by disgruntled players. It seems that the makers of this game, Microgaming, have not learned their lesson from the debacle that was their last release – the Jurassic Park Slot.</p>
<p>Casino Jungle Monkeys is a very basic game, with no bonus rounds and few features to keep players engaged. Even worse, many players are reporting that they are not being paid out on their winsnings. This has resulted in a string of negative online reviews for the game.</p>
<p>Just one look at the CasinoJungleMonkeys twitter account will show you how unhappy people are with this game:</p>
<p>“This @CasinoJungleMonkey game is so terrible I want my money back”</p>
<p>“What a crappy @CasinoJungleMonkey game. No bonus rounds and terrible payout ratios”</p>
<p>“Don’t bother playing @CasinoJungleMonkey – it’s just a waste of time!”</p>
<p>It is clear that Microgaming has once again released a subpar product that is not worth your time or money. Avoid this game at all cost and stick to reputable casinos like 888 or Bet365 instead.</p>
<h1 id="Why-do-Casinos-Love-to-Play-Jungle-Monkeys"><a href="#Why-do-Casinos-Love-to-Play-Jungle-Monkeys" class="headerlink" title="Why do Casinos Love to Play Jungle Monkeys?"></a>Why do Casinos Love to Play Jungle Monkeys?</h1><p>Casinos are always on the lookout for new and exciting games to keep players entertained, and one game that has been gaining popularity in recent years is Jungle Monkeys. This game is a variation of the classic card game known as blackjack, and it is thought to have originated in Brazil.</p>
<p>Jungle Monkeys is a simple game to learn but can be quite tricky to play well, which is why casinos love it. The object of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. Players are dealt two cards face up, and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down.</p>
<p>The player then has the option of either hitting (taking another card) or standing (staying with the current total). If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose the hand. The dealer must hit on 16 or below and stand on 17 or above. The best hand possible is a blackjack, which is an ace plus a ten-value card (either jack, queen or king).</p>
<p>In Jungle Monkeys, there are a few twists that make it more interesting than traditional blackjack. For starters, each player starts with six cards instead of just two, and they are allowed to split pairs and receive extra cards after splitting. Another difference is that Aces can be counted as 1 or 11 depending on what will help the player achieve the best hand possible.</p>
<p>Jungle Monkeys is quickly becoming a favourite among casino players due to its fast-paced action and potential for big payouts. If you want to try your hand at this exciting game, be sure to head to your nearest casino and give it a go!</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-Worst-Game-to-Play-in-a-Casino"><a href="#What-is-the-Worst-Game-to-Play-in-a-Casino" class="headerlink" title="What is the Worst Game to Play in a Casino?"></a>What is the Worst Game to Play in a Casino?</h1><p>There are so many games to choose from when you visit a casino, but which one is the worst? This can depend on your personal preferences, but there are a few contenders that often make the list. The games with the lowest odds of winning tend to be those that involve luck rather than skill, such as slots and roulette. If you’re looking to minimize your chances of walking away empty-handed, it’s best to steer clear of these games.</p>
<p>Another game to avoid if you want to increase your chances of winning is blackjack. While it’s possible to beat the dealer and win big jackpots, the odds are not in your favor if you’re playing against a professional. In fact, the house edge for blackjack is around 1-2%, which means you’re likely to lose money in the long run if you play this game. Craps is another casino game that’s not particularly fruitful for players, as the house edge is about 5%.</p>
<p>So what is the best game to play in a casino? That really depends on what you’re looking for. If you want a chance of winning big jackpots, then slot machines may be ideal for you. However, if you’re looking for a more strategic experience with better odds, then poker or blackjack may be better options. Ultimately, it’s important to do your research before playing any casino game and know what the odds are before placing any bets.</p>
<h1 id="Jungle-Monkeys-The-Most-Unpopular-Game-in-the-Casino"><a href="#Jungle-Monkeys-The-Most-Unpopular-Game-in-the-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Jungle Monkeys: The Most Unpopular Game in the Casino"></a>Jungle Monkeys: The Most Unpopular Game in the Casino</h1><p>Casinos are filled with all sorts of games, but there is one game that is slowly becoming unpopular: the Jungle Monkeys game. This slot machine game has been around for a while, and it was once a favorite among casino goers. However, as time has gone on, people have become tired of it and opted for other games.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why Jungle Monkeys is becoming unpopular. Firstly, the payout percentage is relatively low, which means that players don’t win as often as they would like. Secondly, the bonus rounds are not particularly exciting or lucrative. Finally, the graphics and animations in the game are outdated when compared to more recent slot machine games.</p>
<p>Despite its many flaws, Jungle Monkeys still has some fans who enjoy playing it from time to time. If you’re looking for a new game to play in the casino, we suggest giving one of the newer slots a try – you might just like them better than Jungle Monkeys!</p>
<h1 id="Most-People-Hate-Playing-Jungle-Monkeys-at-the-Casino-But-Why"><a href="#Most-People-Hate-Playing-Jungle-Monkeys-at-the-Casino-But-Why" class="headerlink" title="Most People Hate Playing Jungle Monkeys at the Casino, But Why?"></a>Most People Hate Playing Jungle Monkeys at the Casino, But Why?</h1><p>There are a lot of people who think that playing casino games is a waste of time, but few are as vehement as those who believe that playing Jungle Monkeys is a waste of time. Why do they feel this way?</p>
<p>For one, Jungle Monkeys is known for having relatively low payouts. In fact, the odds of winning at Jungle Monkeys are about 1 in 36, making it one of the least favorable games in the casino. This may not be a problem for some players, but others find it frustrating to put in all that effort without seeing much return.</p>
<p>Another reason why people hate playing Jungle Monkeys is because the game can be quite slow. This is especiallytrue when you’re not winning – every spin seems like it’s taking forever! As a result, many people find themselves quickly losing interest in the game.</p>
<p>Finally, some people simply don’t like the look or feel of Jungle Monkeys. The brightly-colored animals and jungle scenery may not be everyone’s cup of tea, and this can definitely affect how much fun they have while playing.</p>
<p>Despite all these reasons, however, there are still some people who enjoy playing Jungle Monkeys at the casino. If you’re one of them, then go ahead and keep on playing – just know that you’re in the minority!</p>

If you move a token and the next player cannot match its new position, then you win that leaf and take the token. If the next player can match your move, then they take the token instead.

The move makes GGames the first major gaming company to offer sports betting and is expected to give them a large competitive advantage in the market.</p>
<p>“We are excited to offer sports betting to our customers,” said GGames CEO Yang Wei. “This is a natural evolution for our company and we believe it will provide a better experience for our customers.”</p>
<p>The new sports betting platform will be available through GGames’s website and mobile app. Customers will be able to bet on all of the major sporting events, including football, basketball, baseball, and soccer.

<p>Sports betting has been illegal in most states in the United States, but that is starting to change. In May 2018, the US Supreme Court struck down a law that prohibited gambling on sporting events. Since then, several states have legalized sports betting, including Delaware, New Jersey, West Virginia, and Mississippi. More states are likely to follow suit in the coming years.</p>
<p>GGames has been preparing for this moment for years. The company acquired several sports betting companies in 2017 and 2018 and has been working on developing its own sports betting platform.</p>

This was their third consecutive World Series appearance and their first since 1988.</p>
<p>The Dodgers got off to a hot start, scoring four runs in the first inning. Yasiel Puig got things started with a two-run home run. They would add two more runs in the inning on an RBI single by Justin Turner and a bases-loaded walk by Cody Bellinger.</p>
<p>The Cardinals threatened in the second inning, getting runners to second and third with one out. However, Dodgers starter Walker Buehler was able to get out of the jam, striking out Paul Goldschmidt and Yadier Molina.</p>
<p>Buehler continued to dominate the Cardinals, pitching six innings of one-hit ball. He struck out seven and did not allow a walk.</p>
<p>The Dodgers added two more runs in the seventh inning on an RBI double by Chris Taylor and an RBI single by Enrique Hernandez.</p>
<p>Kenley Jansen pitched a perfect ninth inning to secure the victory.</p>
<h1 id="Yankees-Clinch-First-American-League-Wild-Card-Spot-With-11-6-Victory-Over-Orioles"><a href="#Yankees-Clinch-First-American-League-Wild-Card-Spot-With-11-6-Victory-Over-Orioles" class="headerlink" title="Yankees Clinch First American League Wild Card Spot With 11-6 Victory Over Orioles"></a>Yankees Clinch First American League Wild Card Spot With 11-6 Victory Over Orioles</h1><p>The New York Yankees defeated the Baltimore Orioles by a score of 11-6 on Wednesday night, clinching their first American League Wild Card spot in the process.</p>
<p>The Yankees got off to a fast start, scoring five runs in the top of the first inning. Giancarlo Stanton led off with a home run, and later in the inning, Aaron Hicks hit a three-run homer.</p>
<p>Baltimore was able to cut into the Yankee lead with four runs of their own in the bottom of the first inning. Jonathan Schoop hit a two-run homer and Adam Jones added a solo shot.</p>
<p>New York added two more runs in the second inning on an RBI double by Miguel Andujar and an RBI single by Gleyber Torres.</p>
<p>The Orioles made it interesting late, scoring four runs in the bottom of the eighth inning, but it was not enough as Yankees reliever David Robertson got the final three outs to secure the victory.</p>
<p>The Yankees will now wait to see who they will face in the one-game Wild Card playoff on October 3rd.</p>
<h1 id="Red-Sox-Fall-To-Rays-In-AL-East-Finale-Miss-Out-On-Playoff-Berth"><a href="#Red-Sox-Fall-To-Rays-In-AL-East-Finale-Miss-Out-On-Playoff-Berth" class="headerlink" title="Red Sox Fall To Rays In AL East Finale, Miss Out On Playoff Berth"></a>Red Sox Fall To Rays In AL East Finale, Miss Out On Playoff Berth</h1><p>BOSTON — The Boston Red Sox’s season came to an end Sunday with a 5-2 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays.</p>
<p>Boston, which entered the day one game behind the New York Yankees for the second AL wild card, needed to win and have the Yankees lose in order to make the playoffs.</p>
<p>But New York’s 4-1 victory over Toronto coupled with Boston’s loss eliminated the Red Sox from postseason contention.</p>
<p>“We put ourselves in a good spot, but we just didn’t get it done,” said Red Sox manager Alex Cora. “That’s baseball.”</p>
<p>The Red Sox were 95-67 on the season.</p>
<p>Boston starter Nathan Eovaldi allowed four runs in six innings, taking his third loss of the season against Tampa Bay. Ji-Man Choi hit a two-run homer for the Rays, who finished 90-72 on the year.</p>
<p>“It’s tough,” said Eovaldi of missing out on the playoffs. “But we battled all year and had a great team.”</p>
<p>The Red Sox took a 2-0 lead in the first inning on homers by J.D. Martinez and Xander Bogaerts. But Tampa Bay stormed back with four runs in the fourth off Eovaldi, with Choi’s blast putting them ahead for good.</p>

<p>Christian Yelich hit a two-run homer in the first inning and Zach Davies allowed just one run over six innings to lead the Brewers to their 89th win of the season.</p>
<p>Milwaukee will now face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series.</p>
<p>“It feels great,” said outfielder Lorenzo Cain. “This is what we came here for. We battled all year long and it feels good to finally be able to clinch and celebrate with the fans.”</p>
<p>Brewers manager Craig Counsell was proud of his team’s effort throughout the season.</p>
<p>“I could not be more proud of this group,” said Counsell. “They absolutely earned this title. They never stopped fighting and I am just so happy for them.”</p>
<h1 id="Rockies-End-10-Year-Playoff-Drought-Earn-NL-West-Crown-With-6-2-Victory-Over-Dodgers"><a href="#Rockies-End-10-Year-Playoff-Drought-Earn-NL-West-Crown-With-6-2-Victory-Over-Dodgers" class="headerlink" title="Rockies End 10-Year Playoff Drought, Earn NL West Crown With 6-2 Victory Over Dodgers"></a>Rockies End 10-Year Playoff Drought, Earn NL West Crown With 6-2 Victory Over Dodgers</h1><p>DENVER - To say the Colorado Rockies had to overcome some obstacles this season would be a colossal understatement.</p>
<p>The team lost its ace, Jon Gray, to injury in early April. It also had to play without All-Star shortstop Trevor Story for two months due to a torn thumb ligament. Third baseman Nolan Arenado was banged up for large chunks of the year, too.</p>
<p>Despite all that, the Rockies found a way to put it all together down the stretch. They won their final ten games of the regular season - including Wednesday’s 6-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers that clinched the National League West crown - to end a ten-year playoff drought and earn their first division title since 2009.</p>
<p>“It feels great,” said Charlie Blackmon, who was voted NL MVP after leading the league in batting average, home runs and RBIs. “We had a lot of injuries and things not go our way during the season, but we battled through them and now we’re in a good spot.”</p>
<p>The Rockies will open their postseason schedule on Friday night at home against the Atlanta Braves. It will be just their second playoff appearance ever and first since 1995.</p>
<p>“This is something we’ve been working for for a long time,” Arenado said. “We’re not done yet.”</p>
