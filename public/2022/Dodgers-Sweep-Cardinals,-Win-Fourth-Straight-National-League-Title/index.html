        <h1 id="Dodgers-Sweep-Cardinals-Win-Fourth-Straight-National-League-Title"><a href="#Dodgers-Sweep-Cardinals-Win-Fourth-Straight-National-League-Title" class="headerlink" title="Dodgers Sweep Cardinals, Win Fourth Straight National League Title"></a>Dodgers Sweep Cardinals, Win Fourth Straight National League Title</h1><p>The Los Angeles Dodgers won their fourth straight National League championship with a sweep of the Saint Louis Cardinals. This was their third consecutive World Series appearance and their first since 1988.</p>
<p>The Dodgers got off to a hot start, scoring four runs in the first inning. Yasiel Puig got things started with a two-run home run. They would add two more runs in the inning on an RBI single by Justin Turner and a bases-loaded walk by Cody Bellinger.</p>
<p>The Cardinals threatened in the second inning, getting runners to second and third with one out. However, Dodgers starter Walker Buehler was able to get out of the jam, striking out Paul Goldschmidt and Yadier Molina.</p>
<p>Buehler continued to dominate the Cardinals, pitching six innings of one-hit ball. He struck out seven and did not allow a walk.</p>
<p>The Dodgers added two more runs in the seventh inning on an RBI double by Chris Taylor and an RBI single by Enrique Hernandez.</p>
<p>Kenley Jansen pitched a perfect ninth inning to secure the victory.</p>
<h1 id="Yankees-Clinch-First-American-League-Wild-Card-Spot-With-11-6-Victory-Over-Orioles"><a href="#Yankees-Clinch-First-American-League-Wild-Card-Spot-With-11-6-Victory-Over-Orioles" class="headerlink" title="Yankees Clinch First American League Wild Card Spot With 11-6 Victory Over Orioles"></a>Yankees Clinch First American League Wild Card Spot With 11-6 Victory Over Orioles</h1><p>The New York Yankees defeated the Baltimore Orioles by a score of 11-6 on Wednesday night, clinching their first American League Wild Card spot in the process.</p>
<p>The Yankees got off to a fast start, scoring five runs in the top of the first inning. Giancarlo Stanton led off with a home run, and later in the inning, Aaron Hicks hit a three-run homer.</p>
<p>Baltimore was able to cut into the Yankee lead with four runs of their own in the bottom of the first inning. Jonathan Schoop hit a two-run homer and Adam Jones added a solo shot.</p>
<p>New York added two more runs in the second inning on an RBI double by Miguel Andujar and an RBI single by Gleyber Torres.</p>
<p>The Orioles made it interesting late, scoring four runs in the bottom of the eighth inning, but it was not enough as Yankees reliever David Robertson got the final three outs to secure the victory.</p>
<p>The Yankees will now wait to see who they will face in the one-game Wild Card playoff on October 3rd.</p>
<h1 id="Red-Sox-Fall-To-Rays-In-AL-East-Finale-Miss-Out-On-Playoff-Berth"><a href="#Red-Sox-Fall-To-Rays-In-AL-East-Finale-Miss-Out-On-Playoff-Berth" class="headerlink" title="Red Sox Fall To Rays In AL East Finale, Miss Out On Playoff Berth"></a>Red Sox Fall To Rays In AL East Finale, Miss Out On Playoff Berth</h1><p>BOSTON — The Boston Red Sox’s season came to an end Sunday with a 5-2 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays.</p>
<p>Boston, which entered the day one game behind the New York Yankees for the second AL wild card, needed to win and have the Yankees lose in order to make the playoffs.</p>
<p>But New York’s 4-1 victory over Toronto coupled with Boston’s loss eliminated the Red Sox from postseason contention.</p>
<p>“We put ourselves in a good spot, but we just didn’t get it done,” said Red Sox manager Alex Cora. “That’s baseball.”</p>
<p>The Red Sox were 95-67 on the season.</p>
<p>Boston starter Nathan Eovaldi allowed four runs in six innings, taking his third loss of the season against Tampa Bay. Ji-Man Choi hit a two-run homer for the Rays, who finished 90-72 on the year.</p>
<p>“It’s tough,” said Eovaldi of missing out on the playoffs. “But we battled all year and had a great team.”</p>
<p>The Red Sox took a 2-0 lead in the first inning on homers by J.D. Martinez and Xander Bogaerts. But Tampa Bay stormed back with four runs in the fourth off Eovaldi, with Choi’s blast putting them ahead for good.</p>
<h1 id="Brewers-Earn-NL-Central-Title-With-3-1-Win-Over-Cubs"><a href="#Brewers-Earn-NL-Central-Title-With-3-1-Win-Over-Cubs" class="headerlink" title="Brewers Earn NL Central Title With 3-1 Win Over Cubs"></a>Brewers Earn NL Central Title With 3-1 Win Over Cubs</h1><p>The Milwaukee Brewers have clinched their first division title since 2011, defeating the Chicago Cubs 3-1 on Saturday.</p>
<p>Christian Yelich hit a two-run homer in the first inning and Zach Davies allowed just one run over six innings to lead the Brewers to their 89th win of the season.</p>
<p>Milwaukee will now face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series.</p>
<p>“It feels great,” said outfielder Lorenzo Cain. “This is what we came here for. We battled all year long and it feels good to finally be able to clinch and celebrate with the fans.”</p>
<p>Brewers manager Craig Counsell was proud of his team’s effort throughout the season.</p>
<p>“I could not be more proud of this group,” said Counsell. “They absolutely earned this title. They never stopped fighting and I am just so happy for them.”</p>
<h1 id="Rockies-End-10-Year-Playoff-Drought-Earn-NL-West-Crown-With-6-2-Victory-Over-Dodgers"><a href="#Rockies-End-10-Year-Playoff-Drought-Earn-NL-West-Crown-With-6-2-Victory-Over-Dodgers" class="headerlink" title="Rockies End 10-Year Playoff Drought, Earn NL West Crown With 6-2 Victory Over Dodgers"></a>Rockies End 10-Year Playoff Drought, Earn NL West Crown With 6-2 Victory Over Dodgers</h1><p>DENVER - To say the Colorado Rockies had to overcome some obstacles this season would be a colossal understatement.</p>
<p>The team lost its ace, Jon Gray, to injury in early April. It also had to play without All-Star shortstop Trevor Story for two months due to a torn thumb ligament. Third baseman Nolan Arenado was banged up for large chunks of the year, too.</p>
<p>Despite all that, the Rockies found a way to put it all together down the stretch. They won their final ten games of the regular season - including Wednesday’s 6-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers that clinched the National League West crown - to end a ten-year playoff drought and earn their first division title since 2009.</p>
<p>“It feels great,” said Charlie Blackmon, who was voted NL MVP after leading the league in batting average, home runs and RBIs. “We had a lot of injuries and things not go our way during the season, but we battled through them and now we’re in a good spot.”</p>
<p>The Rockies will open their postseason schedule on Friday night at home against the Atlanta Braves. It will be just their second playoff appearance ever and first since 1995.</p>
<p>“This is something we’ve been working for for a long time,” Arenado said. “We’re not done yet.”</p>
