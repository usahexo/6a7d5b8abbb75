        <h1 id="New-York-Attorney-General-Opens-Inquiry-Into-Whether-Mountaineer-Sports-Gambling-Site-Is-in-Compliance-With-State-Law"><a href="#New-York-Attorney-General-Opens-Inquiry-Into-Whether-Mountaineer-Sports-Gambling-Site-Is-in-Compliance-With-State-Law" class="headerlink" title="New York Attorney General Opens Inquiry Into Whether Mountaineer Sports Gambling Site Is in Compliance With State Law"></a>New York Attorney General Opens Inquiry Into Whether Mountaineer Sports Gambling Site Is in Compliance With State Law</h1><p> Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced on Monday that his office has opened an inquiry into whether the Mountaineer Sports Gambling Site, which launched in November, is in compliance with state law.</p>
<p>“As New Yorkers gear up for another year of sports betting, it is important that they can do so safely and legally,” said Attorney General Schneiderman. “That’s why my office is investigating Mountaineer Sports to ensure that it is in compliance with state law. We will not tolerate illegal gambling operations in New York.”</p>
<p>The Mountaineer Sports Gambling Site allows users in New York to bet on sporting events online. In order to operate legally under New York law, the site must be licensed by the State Gaming Commission. The AG’s office has not yet determined whether the Mountaineer Sports Gambling Site is licensed.</p>
<p>This inquiry comes as New York prepares for the upcoming Super Bowl. Schneiderman has previously cracked down on illegal sports betting operations in advance of major sporting events. In 2013, his office shut down an unlicensed sports betting ring that took bets on NFL games.</p>
<h1 id="Mountaineer-Casino-To-Launch-Sports-Betting-Operation"><a href="#Mountaineer-Casino-To-Launch-Sports-Betting-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Mountaineer Casino To Launch Sports Betting Operation"></a>Mountaineer Casino To Launch Sports Betting Operation</h1><p>Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort is all set to launch its sports betting operation from November 1. The West Virginia casino will offer in-person and mobile wagering at the property.</p>
<p>The Mountaineer Casino joins other casinos in the state such as the Wheeling Island Hotel-Casino-Racetrack, the Mardi Gras Casino &amp; Resort, and the Hollywood Casino Perryville in offering sports betting.</p>
<p>The casino has announced that it would offer a range of bets on professional and college sports, starting with the National Football League (NFL) season. American football is particularly popular in West Virginia.</p>
<p>In addition to NFL games, Mountaineer Casino will offer wagers on NCAA Division I games, including men’s and women’s basketball, football, and baseball games. The casino will also offer bets on major international sporting events such as the World Cup.</p>
<p>To place a bet at the Mountaineer Casino, players can visit one of the two sports betting kiosks or use their mobile device to place a bet at any of the six fire pits located throughout the casino floor. Players must be 21 years or older to place a wager.</p>
<p>West Virginia recently amended its gambling laws to allow for sports betting at approved casinos in the state. In August, Governor Jim Justice signed into law Senate Bill 333 which authorized sports betting at licensed racetracks and casinos in West Virginia. The law went into effect on September 1.</p>
<h1 id="West-Virginia-Attorney-General-Says-Mountaineer-Sports-Gambling-Site-In-Compliance-With-State-Laws"><a href="#West-Virginia-Attorney-General-Says-Mountaineer-Sports-Gambling-Site-In-Compliance-With-State-Laws" class="headerlink" title="West Virginia Attorney General Says Mountaineer Sports Gambling Site In Compliance With State Laws"></a>West Virginia Attorney General Says Mountaineer Sports Gambling Site In Compliance With State Laws</h1><p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey says the state’s new Mountaineer Sports gambling site is in compliance with state laws.</p>
<p>In a news release Thursday, Morrisey said his office has completed a review of the new website and found it to be in compliance with state law.</p>
<p>The website went online this week and allows people to bet on college and professional sports games.</p>
<p>Morrisey said his office will continue to monitor the website for any violations of state law.</p>
<h1 id="West-Virginia-Becomes-Fourth-State-To-Authorize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#West-Virginia-Becomes-Fourth-State-To-Authorize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="West Virginia Becomes Fourth State To Authorize Sports Betting"></a>West Virginia Becomes Fourth State To Authorize Sports Betting</h1><p>West Virginia has just authorized sports betting, joining Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey as the only states with legalized wagering. The new law permits casinos and racetracks in the state to offer bets on professional and college sports, as well as other sporting events such as golf and auto racing.</p>
<p>State Senator Craig Blair, one of the authors of the bill, believes that it will be a major boon for the state’s economy. “This is going to create jobs. This is going to create income for our state. We’re already seeing people interested in coming in and investing in our casinos and our racetracks.”</p>
<p>Sports betting is likely to be popular in West Virginia; the state is a major college sports hub, with schools like West Virginia University and Marshall University fielding powerhouse teams. In addition, there are several professional franchises in the state, including the Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens.</p>
<p>The new law imposes a 10% tax on Sports Betting Revenue (SBR), which will be used to fund public schoolteachers’ pensions. While this may seem like a high tax rate, it is actually lower than the tax rates on other forms of gambling in West Virginia. For example, lottery tickets are taxed at 33%, while table games are taxed at 33%.</p>
<p>The passage of this bill is good news for casino operators in West Virginia. Since sports betting is now legal, they can offer consumers a new way to gamble that is likely to be popular. In addition, they will be able to tap into the large market for sports betting that exists nationwide.</p>
<h1 id="Mountaineer-Gaming-Applies-For-Online-Sports-Gambling-License"><a href="#Mountaineer-Gaming-Applies-For-Online-Sports-Gambling-License" class="headerlink" title="Mountaineer Gaming Applies For Online Sports Gambling License"></a>Mountaineer Gaming Applies For Online Sports Gambling License</h1><p>On January 8, 2019, the West Virginia Mountaineer Gaming Corporation (WVMGC) submitted an application to the state’s Alcohol Beverage Control Administration (ABCA) for an online sports gambling license. WVMGC is the parent company of Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack &amp; Resort in Chester, West Virginia.</p>
<p>According to the application, WVMGC plans to offer a variety of sports betting options, including wagers on professional and collegiate sporting events. Bettors will be able to place bets through the company’s website or mobile app.</p>
<p>West Virginia passed legislation authorizing online sports gambling in March 2018. The law allows casinos and racetracks in the state to offer both live and simulcast sports betting. It also permits online wagering by residents of other states where it is legal.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a license, WVMGC must undergo a mandatory FBI criminal background check. The company must also agree to pay a $100,000 licensing fee and file quarterly reports with ABCA on its gaming operations.</p>
<p>The application comes just days after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports gambling. Since then, several states have moved to legalize the activity. Delaware and New Jersey were among the first to do so, followed by Mississippi and West Virginia.</p>
<p>It is unclear when ABCA will make a decision on the WVMGC application.</p>

        <h1 id="Blackjack-Strategy-How-Often-Does-it-Work"><a href="#Blackjack-Strategy-How-Often-Does-it-Work" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Strategy: How Often Does it Work?"></a>Blackjack Strategy: How Often Does it Work?</h1><p>There is no one perfect blackjack strategy that will work 100% of the time. However, there are a number of different strategies that can help you to improve your odds and increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p>One of the most important things to remember when playing blackjack is to always stick to a strategy. This means making the smartest choices possible with regard to when you hit, stand, double down, or split.</p>
<p>One common strategy is the basic strategy, which is a list of moves that will give you the best chance of winning against the dealer’s hand. The basic strategy varies depending on the particular rules of blackjack being played, but it is a good starting point for beginners.</p>
<p>Another popular strategy is card counting. This involves keeping track of what cards have been played in order to estimate how many high value cards are still left in the deck. This information can then be used to make better decisions about when to bet and when to fold.</p>
<p>However, card counting is not as easy as it sounds, and it takes a lot of practice before you can do it effectively. In addition, casinos are aware of this tactic and may ban players who are caught using it.</p>
<p>So does card counting really work? The answer is yes - but only if you are good at it and know what you’re doing. If you’re new to blackjack, it’s probably best to start with the basic strategy and work your way up from there.</p>
<h1 id="How-Often-do-You-Win-Playing-Blackjack"><a href="#How-Often-do-You-Win-Playing-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="How Often do You Win Playing Blackjack?"></a>How Often do You Win Playing Blackjack?</h1><p>Blackjack has long been popular both in brick and mortar casinos, as well as through online casino platforms. It is one of the simplest casino games to play and offers relatively good odds for players, making it a favourite for many gamblers. But, just how often do you win when playing blackjack?</p>
<p>The odds of winning at blackjack depends on a variety of factors, including the game variant you are playing and your card counting skills. Overall, the odds are favourable for players, with around a 54% chance of winning when playing basic strategy blackjack. However, this percentage can be improved with card counting, which can give players an edge of up to 2%. This means that if you are a skilled counter, you can expect to win around 56% of the time when playing blackjack.</p>
<p>Of course, your chances of winning also depend on the casino you are playing at. The house edge at most casinos is around 2-3%, so if you are unlucky enough to be playing at one of these establishments, your chances of winning will be lower. By contrast, if you choose an online casino with a good player-friendly reputation, such as CasinoEuro or Mr Green Casino, your chances of winning will be much higher.</p>
<p>So overall, while blackjack is not a guaranteed win, it is a fairly simple game to play with good odds for players. With a bit of practice and skillful play, you could be raking in the wins every time you hit the casino floor!</p>
<h1 id="Best-Way-to-Play-Blackjack-and-Win"><a href="#Best-Way-to-Play-Blackjack-and-Win" class="headerlink" title="Best Way to Play Blackjack and Win"></a>Best Way to Play Blackjack and Win</h1><p>There are variations of blackjack to make the game more fun and increase the odds of winning. With some tips, it is possible to get ahead of the house everytime you play blackjack. </p>
<p>First, find a table that has favorable rules for the player. The dealer’s stand on all 17s rule is favorable for the player. Avoid tables that allow doubling down after splitting; this rule diminishes the edge of basic strategy. Look for casinos that offer a 3:2 payoff on blackjacks—instead of the traditional 6:5. Also, make sure dealers hit soft 17 (a hand consisting of an Ace and a six, which totals 7). </p>
<p>Next, select a betting range you are comfortable with and stick to it. You don’t want to go too crazy with your bets and risk losing more than you planned on. Start by betting the minimum amount at first, and then increase your bet as you become more comfortable with the game. </p>
<p>In order to improve your chances of winning, learn basic strategy. Knowing when to hit, stand, double down or split will help reduce the house edge from 0.5% to as low as 0.1%. You can find several online tutorials that will teach you how to play blackjack using basic strategy charts. </p>
<p>Another way to improve your odds is by using a counting system like Hi-Lo or Knock-Out. However, this takes some practice and isn’t necessary if you are just playing for fun. In general, the more experience you have playing blackjack, the better your chances of winning will be.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Strategy-How-Often-Does-it-Fail"><a href="#Blackjack-Strategy-How-Often-Does-it-Fail" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Strategy - How Often Does it Fail?"></a>Blackjack Strategy - How Often Does it Fail?</h1><p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games and it is easy to see why. It is a simple game to understand, but offers players the chance to win big payouts if they can correctly predict the cards that will be dealt.</p>
<p>The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer by either getting as close to 21 as possible or by having a higher total than the dealer. Players can also choose to take extra cards in an attempt to beat the dealer.</p>
<p>There are a number of different blackjack strategies that can be used in order to give players the best chance of winning. One such strategy is called basic strategy and it has been proven to be the most successful way to play blackjack. However, there are occasions when this strategy can fail. In this article, we will take a look at when basic strategy fails and how often it does so.</p>
<p>Basic strategy is a system that was developed in order to help players make the best decision possible when it comes to their hand. The basic strategy chart takes into account all of the different cards that can be played and provides players with the best move to make in any given situation. While following basic strategy will not guarantee a win, it does give players the best chance possible of coming out on top.</p>
<p>There are times, however, when basic strategy will fail. This usually happens when there is a mismatch between what is on the player’s hand and what is available on the table. For example, if you have an Ace and a King as your first two cards, you should always hit (take another card) as your chances of drawing another Ace or King are high. If you have Ace-6 however, you should stand (not take any more cards) as there are only two low cards left in the deck that could help improve your hand.</p>
<p>There are other occasions when basic strategy can fail too. For example, if you have more than one ace in your hand, you may want to split them up into two separate hands. If you have 16 points total with two Aces, for example, splitting them would give you two new hands with 8 points each – making it much more likely that one of those hands will get close to 21 points. However, if the dealer has an Ace showing as their first card, then they are likely to bust if they take another card – meaning that splitting your two Aces would not be such a good idea after all!</p>
<p>As you can see, there are occasions when following basic strategy will not lead to the best possible outcome for players. However, this does not mean that using basic strategy is a bad idea – far from it! Basic strategy is still statistically better than any other method available and should always be used whenever possible in order to give yourself the best chance of winning at blackjack.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-Probability-of-Winning-at-Blackjack"><a href="#What-is-the-Probability-of-Winning-at-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="What is the Probability of Winning at Blackjack?"></a>What is the Probability of Winning at Blackjack?</h1><p>The probability of winning at blackjack depends on a number of factors, including the player’s hand, the dealer’s hand, and the rules of the game. In general, the chance of winning is about 47.37%. This means that if you play blackjack many times, you will win about 47% of the time.</p>
<p>However, the odds can vary depending on the situation. For example, if the player has a blackjack (a hand with an Ace and a 10), the probability of winning is about 97.3%. On the other hand, if the dealer has a blackjack, the probability of losing is about 2.7%.</p>
<p>There are also a number of rules that can affect the odds. For example, some casinos allow players to double down on any two cards, while others require that players double down only on certain hands. Similarly, some casinos allow players to split their cards twice, while others limit players to splitting once.</p>
<p>Overall, there are many factors that can affect the probability of winning at blackjack. To maximize your chances of winning, it is important to understand these factors and make smart decisions based on the situation.</p>

It’s easy to learn, but can be challenging to play well. Here are some tips to help you win big at bingo!</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is learn how to play the game. There are many variations, but the basic premise is the same: mark off numbers on your card as they are called, and try to get five in a row. The first player to do so wins the round.</p>
<p>To increase your chances of winning, it’s important to know about the different types of bingo cards and what each one offers. There are three main types: regular cards with 15 numbers; coverall cards with either 25 or 30 numbers; and progressive jackpot cards with either 50 or 75 numbers. Progressive jackpot cards offer the chance to win large sums of money for a small investment, so if you’re looking to win big, this is the type of card to choose.</p>
<p>In order to win a progressive jackpot, you’ll need to pull an eye – that is, mark off five consecutive numbers in a row on your card. This can be done in any direction: up, down, left or right. It’s not always easy to do, but with a bit of luck and perseverance you’ll be able to claim the big prize!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-win-at-bingo-Use-the-Palau-method"><a href="#How-to-win-at-bingo-Use-the-Palau-method" class="headerlink" title="How to win at bingo: Use the Palau method!"></a>How to win at bingo: Use the Palau method!</h1><p>Bingo is a popular game that can be played in many different ways. Some people prefer to use their own method of playing, while others like to follow the guidelines set by the game’s creators. If you want to win at bingo, it’s important to use a method that works well for you.</p>
<p>One popular method is known as the Palau method. This approach was developed by a man named Don Palau and has been used by many people to win big prizes at bingo tournaments. Here are the steps you need to follow in order to use this method:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose your bingo cards carefully. You should choose cards that have plenty of numbers in them, especially those that are located in the corners and along the edges of the card.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mark off all of the numbers on your card as they are called. This may take some time, but it’s important to stay focused and make sure you don’t miss any numbers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pay attention to the patterns that are being formed. When you see a pattern that is about to be completed, mark off the numbers in that pattern on your card.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep track of how many numbers are left on your card. As soon as there are only five or six numbers left, start marking them off one at a time until you win!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Win-at-bingo-using-the-Palau-technique-Pull-an-eye"><a href="#Win-at-bingo-using-the-Palau-technique-Pull-an-eye" class="headerlink" title="Win at bingo using the Palau technique: Pull an eye!"></a>Win at bingo using the Palau technique: Pull an eye!</h1><p>There are all sorts of suggestions on how to win at bingo, but the Palau technique is perhaps the most unusual. This involves deliberately pulling an eye from the ball in order to give yourself an advantage.</p>
<p>Whether this actually works or not is up for debate, but there is no harm in trying! The theory behind it is that by removing an eye, you are decreasing the number of potential balls that could be called. This can then give you a better chance of winning, as you have fewer options to choose from.</p>
<p>So, how do you go about pulling an eye from a bingo ball? It’s not as easy as it sounds and it takes a lot of practice to perfect the technique. First of all, you need to get your hands on a bingo ball. They are usually available from online retailers or bingo halls.</p>
<p>Next, hold the ball in one hand and use your other hand to push and pull at the eyes until one comes loose. It’s important to be gentle and take your time so that you don’t damage the ball. Once you have removed an eye, place it somewhere safe so that you can reuse it later on.</p>
<p>Now that you have your own personal bingo ball with one missing eye, it’s time to put it into action! When playing bingo, simply call out ‘one eyed jackpot’ every time that number is called. This will let everyone know that you are using the Palau technique and give you an edge over your opponents.</p>
<p>Some people argue that this gives players an unfair advantage, while others claim that it simply levels the playing field. Ultimately, it’s up to you whether or not to use this strategy when playing bingo – but it can be great for increasing your chances of winning big!</p>
<h1 id="Bingo-pulled-an-eye-–-how-to-win-Palau-style"><a href="#Bingo-pulled-an-eye-–-how-to-win-Palau-style" class="headerlink" title="Bingo pulled an eye – how to win Palau style!"></a>Bingo pulled an eye – how to win Palau style!</h1><p>There are many ways to win at bingo, but Palau style is a little different. It’s all about the timing.</p>
<p>When the caller says “Bingo!” everyone looks around to see who called it first. The winner is the person who has the eye closest to the caller.</p>
<p>If there’s more than one person with an eye closest to the caller, then the winner is the person who called bingo first.</p>
<p>If there’s still more than one person, then the winner is the person with the biggest eye.</p>

However, not all of these games are created equal and there is a big difference between playing a slots game that is based on chance and one that is based on skill. </p>
<p>For example, Willy Wonka Slot Device Philippines is a game that is based on skill. This means that players have a better chance of winning if they use strategies and tips to improve their chances. In this article, we will share some secrets of winning at Willy Wonka Slot Device Philippines so that you can walk away with some extra cash in your pocket.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it is important to learn the basics of the game. This includes understanding how the paylines work, understanding the symbols and knowing when to bet. Once you have mastered these basics, you can start to implement some of the following tips into your gameplay:</p>
<p>-Don’t always bet the maximum amount. Sometimes it is wiser to bet lower amounts in order to increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p>-Only bet when you are feeling confident about your chances. If you don’t feel like you have a good grip on the game, it might be best to walk away until next time.</p>
<p>-Always keep a close eye on the payout table. This will help you understand what symbols payout what amounts and which ones are worth chasing after. </p>
<p>-Watch the other players at the machine to see if they are winning or losing. This can give you an idea about where the odds currently lie for certain symbols. </p>
<p>-Use bonuses wisely. Bonuses can be extremely helpful in boosting your bankroll but make sure that you know when to use them and when to hold back. For instance, using a bonus too early in the game could mean that you don’t have enough money left to continue playing if you don’t win big right away. </p>
<p>-Take advantage of wild symbols whenever they appear on the screen. These symbols can help increase your chances of landing a winning combination significantly. </p>
<p>-Keep track of your progress by using a gambling journal. This way, you can track wins and losses as well as identify any patterns that may be emerging in your gameplay.</p>

<p>“I’m very proud of myself,” said an emotional Agarwal after winning. “I’ve worked so hard for this and I’m glad that all my effort has paid off.”</p>

<p>The final table was a star-studded affair, with some of the biggest names in poker competing for the title. But in the end, it was Raja who emerged victorious.</p>
<p>When he won, there were scenes of wild celebration back in India. His friends and family were overjoyed at his amazing accomplishment.</p>

<p>Raja’s road to victory was not easy; he had to overcome some very tough competition along the way. But in the end, he proved himself to be the best player at the table.</p>

<p>The Washington Wizards have not been playing well lately and this loss was just another example of that. The Washington Wizards need to find a way to get back on track if they want to make a run in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Otto Porter Jr. led the Washington Wizards with 23 points, but it was not enough against the Golden State Warriors. Bradley Beal added 18 points but also struggled offensively.</p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors were led by Stephen Curry who had 31 points, six rebounds, and five assists. Kevin Durant chipped in with 27 points, 10 rebounds, and six assists for the Golden State Warriors. Klay Thompson added 22 points for the Golden State Warriors.</p>
<p>The Washington Wizards will hope to rebound from this loss when they take on the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Wizards-Fall-to-Oklahoma-City-Thunder-Owe-More-Than-Just-Points"><a href="#Washington-Wizards-Fall-to-Oklahoma-City-Thunder-Owe-More-Than-Just-Points" class="headerlink" title="Washington Wizards Fall to Oklahoma City Thunder; Owe More Than Just Points"></a>Washington Wizards Fall to Oklahoma City Thunder; Owe More Than Just Points</h1><p>The Washington Wizards fell to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday, December 3rd. This was a game the Wizards desperately needed in order to keep up with their Eastern Conference counterparts, as well as gain some ground on the Thunder themselves. Washington falls to 14-11 on the season, and 6-8 on the road. The Wizards were led by Otto Porter Jr.’s 21 points and Marcin Gortat’s 10 rebounds, but it was not enough.</p>
<p>This game was not simply about the scoreboard though. The Wizards may have lost in terms of numbers and points, but they may have actually won in terms of what this game showed about them. This gave Washington an opportunity to see where they stand against one of the top teams in the West, and also revealed some glaring weaknesses that they will need to address if they want to make any noise come playoff time.</p>
<p>Chief among these deficiencies? The Wizards’ lack of a go-to scorer. When John Wall or Bradley Beal are shut down, there is no one else who can take over offensively and carry Washington to a win. This was painfully evident against Oklahoma City, as Porter Jr. and Gortat were the only two players able to score in double figures. With Wall sidelined for much of December with a knee injury, Washington will need someone else on the team to step up and become a consistent threat offensively if they hope to make any real noise in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Aside from their scoring issues, another problem that cropped up for Washington against Oklahoma City was their lack of rim protection. The Thunder are one of the most potent offensive teams in the league, and they were able to feast mostly uncontested at the rim thanks to Washington’s inability to contest shots or rebound consistently. Gortat is Washington’s best interior defender, but even he is not capable of guarding every player one-on-one. If teams like Oklahoma City continue to dominate inside like they did on Sunday, Washington could be in for a tough postseason run.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Washington, many of these problems are correctable. They have proven themselves capable of competing against top teams in the past, and with Wall back at full strength they should be even more dangerous offensively. Additionally, it is possible that players like Kelly Oubre Jr., Markieff Morris, and Tomas Satoransky will begin to contribute more consistently as the season goes on. If all these pieces fall into place for Washington, they could easily be a contender for Eastern Conference supremacy.</p>
<p>For now however, it is clear that they still have some work to do before they can be considered serious title contenders. Losing games like Sunday’s against Oklahoma City can be valuable learning experiences if you learn from them properly; we will see if Washington can do just that as they move forward this season.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Wizards-Fail-to-Sweep-Orlando-Magic-Owe-more-than-Pride"><a href="#Washington-Wizards-Fail-to-Sweep-Orlando-Magic-Owe-more-than-Pride" class="headerlink" title="Washington Wizards Fail to Sweep Orlando Magic, Owe more than Pride"></a>Washington Wizards Fail to Sweep Orlando Magic, Owe more than Pride</h1><p>The Washington Wizards failed to sweep the Orlando Magic in their first round matchup in the NBA Playoffs. The Wizards now owe more than just their pride to the Magic.</p>
<p>The Wizards were up by as many as 20 points in game four, but the Magic made a furious comeback to take the lead in the fourth quarter. Washington was able to tie the game, but ultimately lost in overtime.</p>
<p>The loss means that the Wizards will now have to win at least one game in Orlando if they want to advance to the next round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>Washington’s inability to close out the Magic was due largely to their poor shooting from beyond the arc. The Wizards shot just 7-30 from three-point range, which is well below their season average of 36 percent.</p>
<p>Bradley Beal was particularly ineffective from three-point range, going 2-13 on the night. John Wall also had an off night shooting, going 5-16 from the field.</p>
<p>Washington’s lack of shooting was especially problematic given that Orlando was one of the worst teams in the league from three-point range this season. The Magic shot just 33 percent from three-point range during the regular season, which was second worst in the NBA.</p>
<p>Despite their poor shooting, Washington was still able to take a commanding lead early in game four thanks to their defense. The Wizards held Orlando to just 34 percent shooting from the field and 26 percent shooting from three-point range.</p>
<p>However, Washington’s defense faded down the stretch as Orlando mounted their comeback. The Magic were able to score 116 points in regulation and overtime despite shooting below 30 percent from both two and three point range.</p>
<p>If Washington is going to win in Orlando, they will need better performances from both Wall and Beal offensively, and they will need to keep up their defensive intensity for all 48 minutes.</p>
<h1 id="Atlanta-Hawks-End-Washington-Wizards’-Hopes-of-an-Odom-Victory"><a href="#Atlanta-Hawks-End-Washington-Wizards’-Hopes-of-an-Odom-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Atlanta Hawks End Washington Wizards’ Hopes of an Odom Victory"></a>Atlanta Hawks End Washington Wizards’ Hopes of an Odom Victory</h1><p>The Washington Wizards were hoping for an upset victory by Lamar Odom, but the Atlanta Hawks would not let that happen. Al Horford and Josh Smith each had double-doubles to lead the Hawks to a 103-88 victory.</p>
<p>Odom was the only scorer in double figures for the Wizards with 11 points. He also led the team in rebounds with 10. Other than that, there was not much good news for Washington.</p>
<p>The Hawks were led by Horford’s 18 points and 13 rebounds and Smith’s 17 points and 14 rebounds. Joe Johnson also scored 16 points for Atlanta.</p>
<p>The Hawks (27-21) have now won two games in a row and six of their last seven games. The Wizards (9-39) have now lost eight in a row.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Wizards-Could-not-Rise-Above-the-Detroit-Pistons-Owed-Them-One"><a href="#Washington-Wizards-Could-not-Rise-Above-the-Detroit-Pistons-Owed-Them-One" class="headerlink" title="Washington Wizards Could not Rise Above the Detroit Pistons, Owed Them One"></a>Washington Wizards Could not Rise Above the Detroit Pistons, Owed Them One</h1><p>The Washington Wizards were coming into their matchup against the Detroit Pistons feeling confident. They had won their last game against the Cleveland Cavaliers and they were hoping to add another win to their record before they started their long road trip. However, the Pistons had other plans. The Wizards were not able to rise above the Pistons and ended up losing 106-95.</p>
<p>The Wizards played fairly well in the first half, ending it with a 53-51 lead. However, they were not able to keep up that momentum in the second half. The Pistons outscored them 55-42 in the second half and ended up winning the game 106-95. Bradley Beal led the Wizards with 24 points while John Wall had 21 points and 12 assists. The loss snapped Washington’s six-game winning streak and now they will have to try and get back on track on their upcoming road trip.</p>
<p>The Spurs await on Wednesday night in San Antonio, followed by contests at Portland, Utah, Denver and Golden State. Given that all five of those teams currently have winning records - including Portland (15-10), Utah (15-10) and Denver (14-11) - this would seem like a daunting prospect for Washington even if it weren’t for its current four-game skid on the road. “We’re just going to have to play hard,” Beal said afterward. “We can’t take anybody lightly.”</p>
<p>Wall echoed similar sentiments following the latest defeat, which came despite his double-double effort: “We’ve just got to go out there Wednesday (against San Antonio) with a lot of intensity … playing one of the best teams in our league right now.”</p>
