        <h1 id="New-York-Attorney-General-Opens-Inquiry-Into-Whether-Mountaineer-Sports-Gambling-Site-Is-in-Compliance-With-State-Law"><a href="#New-York-Attorney-General-Opens-Inquiry-Into-Whether-Mountaineer-Sports-Gambling-Site-Is-in-Compliance-With-State-Law" class="headerlink" title="New York Attorney General Opens Inquiry Into Whether Mountaineer Sports Gambling Site Is in Compliance With State Law"></a>New York Attorney General Opens Inquiry Into Whether Mountaineer Sports Gambling Site Is in Compliance With State Law</h1><p> Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced on Monday that his office has opened an inquiry into whether the Mountaineer Sports Gambling Site, which launched in November, is in compliance with state law.</p>
<p>“As New Yorkers gear up for another year of sports betting, it is important that they can do so safely and legally,” said Attorney General Schneiderman. “That’s why my office is investigating Mountaineer Sports to ensure that it is in compliance with state law. We will not tolerate illegal gambling operations in New York.”</p>
<p>The Mountaineer Sports Gambling Site allows users in New York to bet on sporting events online. In order to operate legally under New York law, the site must be licensed by the State Gaming Commission. The AG’s office has not yet determined whether the Mountaineer Sports Gambling Site is licensed.</p>
<p>This inquiry comes as New York prepares for the upcoming Super Bowl. Schneiderman has previously cracked down on illegal sports betting operations in advance of major sporting events. In 2013, his office shut down an unlicensed sports betting ring that took bets on NFL games.</p>
<h1 id="Mountaineer-Casino-To-Launch-Sports-Betting-Operation"><a href="#Mountaineer-Casino-To-Launch-Sports-Betting-Operation" class="headerlink" title="Mountaineer Casino To Launch Sports Betting Operation"></a>Mountaineer Casino To Launch Sports Betting Operation</h1><p>Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort is all set to launch its sports betting operation from November 1. The West Virginia casino will offer in-person and mobile wagering at the property.</p>
<p>The Mountaineer Casino joins other casinos in the state such as the Wheeling Island Hotel-Casino-Racetrack, the Mardi Gras Casino &amp; Resort, and the Hollywood Casino Perryville in offering sports betting.</p>
<p>The casino has announced that it would offer a range of bets on professional and college sports, starting with the National Football League (NFL) season. American football is particularly popular in West Virginia.</p>
<p>In addition to NFL games, Mountaineer Casino will offer wagers on NCAA Division I games, including men’s and women’s basketball, football, and baseball games. The casino will also offer bets on major international sporting events such as the World Cup.</p>
<p>To place a bet at the Mountaineer Casino, players can visit one of the two sports betting kiosks or use their mobile device to place a bet at any of the six fire pits located throughout the casino floor. Players must be 21 years or older to place a wager.</p>
<p>West Virginia recently amended its gambling laws to allow for sports betting at approved casinos in the state. In August, Governor Jim Justice signed into law Senate Bill 333 which authorized sports betting at licensed racetracks and casinos in West Virginia. The law went into effect on September 1.</p>
<h1 id="West-Virginia-Attorney-General-Says-Mountaineer-Sports-Gambling-Site-In-Compliance-With-State-Laws"><a href="#West-Virginia-Attorney-General-Says-Mountaineer-Sports-Gambling-Site-In-Compliance-With-State-Laws" class="headerlink" title="West Virginia Attorney General Says Mountaineer Sports Gambling Site In Compliance With State Laws"></a>West Virginia Attorney General Says Mountaineer Sports Gambling Site In Compliance With State Laws</h1><p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey says the state’s new Mountaineer Sports gambling site is in compliance with state laws.</p>
<p>In a news release Thursday, Morrisey said his office has completed a review of the new website and found it to be in compliance with state law.</p>
<p>The website went online this week and allows people to bet on college and professional sports games.</p>
<p>Morrisey said his office will continue to monitor the website for any violations of state law.</p>
<h1 id="West-Virginia-Becomes-Fourth-State-To-Authorize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#West-Virginia-Becomes-Fourth-State-To-Authorize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="West Virginia Becomes Fourth State To Authorize Sports Betting"></a>West Virginia Becomes Fourth State To Authorize Sports Betting</h1><p>West Virginia has just authorized sports betting, joining Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey as the only states with legalized wagering. The new law permits casinos and racetracks in the state to offer bets on professional and college sports, as well as other sporting events such as golf and auto racing.</p>
<p>State Senator Craig Blair, one of the authors of the bill, believes that it will be a major boon for the state’s economy. “This is going to create jobs. This is going to create income for our state. We’re already seeing people interested in coming in and investing in our casinos and our racetracks.”</p>
<p>Sports betting is likely to be popular in West Virginia; the state is a major college sports hub, with schools like West Virginia University and Marshall University fielding powerhouse teams. In addition, there are several professional franchises in the state, including the Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens.</p>
<p>The new law imposes a 10% tax on Sports Betting Revenue (SBR), which will be used to fund public schoolteachers’ pensions. While this may seem like a high tax rate, it is actually lower than the tax rates on other forms of gambling in West Virginia. For example, lottery tickets are taxed at 33%, while table games are taxed at 33%.</p>
<p>The passage of this bill is good news for casino operators in West Virginia. Since sports betting is now legal, they can offer consumers a new way to gamble that is likely to be popular. In addition, they will be able to tap into the large market for sports betting that exists nationwide.</p>
<h1 id="Mountaineer-Gaming-Applies-For-Online-Sports-Gambling-License"><a href="#Mountaineer-Gaming-Applies-For-Online-Sports-Gambling-License" class="headerlink" title="Mountaineer Gaming Applies For Online Sports Gambling License"></a>Mountaineer Gaming Applies For Online Sports Gambling License</h1><p>On January 8, 2019, the West Virginia Mountaineer Gaming Corporation (WVMGC) submitted an application to the state’s Alcohol Beverage Control Administration (ABCA) for an online sports gambling license. WVMGC is the parent company of Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack &amp; Resort in Chester, West Virginia.</p>
<p>According to the application, WVMGC plans to offer a variety of sports betting options, including wagers on professional and collegiate sporting events. Bettors will be able to place bets through the company’s website or mobile app.</p>
<p>West Virginia passed legislation authorizing online sports gambling in March 2018. The law allows casinos and racetracks in the state to offer both live and simulcast sports betting. It also permits online wagering by residents of other states where it is legal.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a license, WVMGC must undergo a mandatory FBI criminal background check. The company must also agree to pay a $100,000 licensing fee and file quarterly reports with ABCA on its gaming operations.</p>
<p>The application comes just days after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports gambling. Since then, several states have moved to legalize the activity. Delaware and New Jersey were among the first to do so, followed by Mississippi and West Virginia.</p>
<p>It is unclear when ABCA will make a decision on the WVMGC application.</p>
